# Library Project
Book library that shows details of books

## Description
This website we made was done by using Express.JS. The main idea of this website is to show a library of books and have details of it such as the Picture, Title, the Author, the year it was published and description of it. When you click on more, it will redirect you to a page that shows details of that one book alone.
